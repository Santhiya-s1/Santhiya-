Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student object as input and sorts the 
list based on their CGPA(cumulative grade point average)in descending order .each student object 
has the following attributes:name(string ),roll_number (string),and cgpa(float).test the function 
with different input lists of students 
'''

class student:

  def __init__(self, name, roll_number, cgpa):
    self.name = name
    self.roll_number = roll_number
    self.cgpa = cgpa


def sort_students(student_list):
  #sort the list of student to descending order of CGPA  
   sort_students  =sorted(student_list, 
       key= lambda student: student.cgpa,
       reverse=True)
   #syntax -lambda org.exp
   return sort_students

   
  #example usage:
students = [
    student("Pavi", "A123", 7.8),
    student("vishva", "A124", 8.9),
    student("Lokesh ", "A125", 9.1),
    student("nisha", "A126", 9.9),
]

#print the sorted list of students
for students in sorted_students:
  print("Name:{},Roll_Number :{},CGPA:{}".format(students.name,
students.roll_number,
                    students.cgpa))
